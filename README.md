### Hi, I’m Jared 👋

I’m a Senior Bioinformatics Research Scientist in Suzanne Baker’s lab in
the Department of Developmental Neurobiology at St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital. We study oncohistone mutations in the context of
pediatric high grade gliomas.

Other than analysis, I build useful tools and utilities for the lab and
community. Recently, I created a basic utility called
[**strprofiler**](https://github.com/j-andrews7/strprofiler) for
comparing STR profiles between large collections and identifying
potential sample swaps. This is particularly useful for labs that
generate many cell lines/models, as we do.

Lately, I’ve been working on an R package called
[**CRISPRball**](https://github.com/j-andrews7/CRISPRball), which is
largely based around a Shiny app of the same name for exploring,
visualizing, and comparing CRISPR-Cas9 screens analyzed with
[**MAGeCK**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mageck/). While this is a
work in progress, it is functionally complete and will hopefully be in
the next release of Bioconductor.

I am/have been involved in a handful of Bioconductor packages, including
[dittoSeq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/dittoSeq.html),
[SingleR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleR.html),
[escape](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/escape.html),
and
[celldex](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/celldex.html).
