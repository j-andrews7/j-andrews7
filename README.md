### Hi, Iâ€™m Jared ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Senior Bioinformatics Research Scientist in Suzanne Bakerâ€™s lab in
the Department of Developmental Neurobiology at St.Â Jude Childrenâ€™s
Research Hospital. We study oncohistone mutations in the context of
pediatric high grade gliomas.

Other than analysis, I build useful tools and utilities for the lab and
community. Recently, I created a basic utility called
[**strprofiler**](https://github.com/j-andrews7/strprofiler) for
comparing STR profiles between large collections and identifying
potential sample swaps. This is particularly useful for labs that
generate many cell lines/models, as we do.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been working on an R package called
[**CRISPRball**](https://github.com/j-andrews7/CRISPRball), which is
largely based around a Shiny app of the same name for exploring,
visualizing, and comparing CRISPR-Cas9 screens analyzed with
[**MAGeCK**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mageck/). While this is a
work in progress, it is functionally complete and will hopefully be in
the next release of Bioconductor.

I am/have been involved in a handful of Bioconductor packages, including
[dittoSeq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/dittoSeq.html),
[SingleR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleR.html),
[escape](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/escape.html),
and
[celldex](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/celldex.html).
